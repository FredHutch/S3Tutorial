# Using S3 with Cyberduck at Fred Hutch

## Step 1: Obtain your AWS Credentials

To use Cyberduck with S3, you will need AWS credentials. You can obtain them by going to

[https://toolbox.fhcrc.org/sw2srv/aws/account](https://toolbox.fhcrc.org/sw2srv/aws/account)

Notes:

* This page will prompt you for your HutchNet ID and password.
* You can only access this page from the Fred Hutch network (or when connected via VPN).

This page will display your Access Key and Secret Key. Please keep this page open for use in the next step.

**NOTE**: Do NOT share these credentials with any other user, inside or outside of Fred Hutch. If another Fred Hutch
employee needs credentials, they can obtain their own credentials in this same manner. If you need credentials for an
external collaborator, or if you are having a permissions issue,
please contact [Scientific Computing](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/cio/scicomp.html).
