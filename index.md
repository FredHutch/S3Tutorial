Notes:

* This page will prompt you for your HutchNet ID and password.
* You can only access this page from the Fred Hutch network (or when connected via VPN). 

This page will display your Access Key and Secret Key. Please keep this page open for use in the next step.

## Step 2: Install Cyberduck

You can get Cyberduck at [https://cyberduck.io/](https://cyberduck.io/). If you are on a Windows system, click the "Download Cyberduck for Windows" link on the left side of the page. If you are on a Mac, click the "Download Cyberduck for Mac" link on the left side of the page. In either case, a file will be downloaded.

### Windows Installation

* Double-click the file that was downloaded in the previous step. Click "Install". Click "Yes" when asked if you want to allow the program to make changes on the computer. If all goes well, after a short installation, you should see "Installation Successfully Completed". Click "Close". 

* To run Cyberduck, click the Start button, then click the Search (magnifying glass) icon in the upper right, and type `cyberduck` into the search box that shows up, and press Enter. Cyberduck will start. To make it easier to start in the future, locate the Cyberduck icon in your task bar at the bottom of the screen, and right-click on it, then select "Pin this program to taskbar". You'll now be able to start Cyberduck just by clicking on that icon, will will remain there even when Cyberduck is not running.

### Mac Installation

* Double-click on the zip file that was downloaded in the previous step. This will open a Finder menu showing the default download directory (usually `Downloads` under your home directory) with the Cyberduck application selected. At this point you could go ahead and start Cyberduck by double-clicking on it, but it will be easier to find Cyberduck in future if it is installed in `/Applications` with your other apps. 

#### Moving Cyberduck to Applications

* Go to Finder.
* Click on the `File` menu at the top of your screen and choose `New Finder Window`. (You can also accomplish this by pressing âŒ˜N (Command-N)).
* In the new window, click on Applications.
* Go to the other Finder window where the Cyberduck application is selected. Drag the Cyberduck icon to the Applications directory in the other finder window.
* You will now always be able to find Cyberduck in `/Applications` along with all your other apps.
* Double-click the Cyberduck icon.
* When you see the dialog box that says "Cyberduck is an application downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?", click "Open".
